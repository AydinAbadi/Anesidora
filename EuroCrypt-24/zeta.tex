\subsubsection{Confidentiality of polynomial $\zeta$.} 

 The dealer is the sole entity responsible for selecting and possessing knowledge of the secret polynomial $\zeta$.  This polynomial remains confidential until all parties submit their messages to the smart contract. Subsequently, in step \ref{f-psi::D-gen-switching-poly} on page~\pageref{f-psi::D-gen-switching-poly}, the dealer transmits $\zeta$ to the smart contract. After this juncture, $\zeta$ is no longer a secret. However, malicious parties gain no advantage from knowing $\zeta$, as they have already submitted their inputs to the smart contract.
