\subsubsection{Confidentiality of polynomial $\zeta$.} 

The dealer is the only party who picks and knows the secret polynomial $\zeta$. This polynomial remains secret until all parties provide their messages to the smart contract. Then, the dealer in step \ref{f-psi::D-gen-switching-poly} on page~\pageref{f-psi::D-gen-switching-poly} sends $\zeta$ to the smart contract. After this point it is not secret, however, the know of $\zeta$ would not benefit malicious parties at this point, as they have all provided their inputs to the smart contract.
